docker comtainer created from docker images downloaded from dockerhub replaces VMs for development. 
e.g. -> DB Maridb can be imported to a development environment and can be run with just basic commands. makes import easy.


Download from docs.dockers.com for windows. 
Install with all default configuration.


Verify Docker -->
in cmd -- docker version


After successful connection to internet --


docker pull <image_name>:<version> 
e.g. - docker pull mariadb:10.11.8
--> to pull/download the images from docker hub


docker images --> to list all the pulled/downloaded images 


docker rmi <image_name> --> to remove a downloaded image from local environment 


docker run <image_name> --> after running a docker image the container with all default configuration
docker run [[parameters]] <image_name> --> 
-- other parameters can also be configured during run
-- -d to run in the detached mode
-- --name <container_reference_name> -- to refer to the container after successful run  
-- -p<local_port>:<container_port> -- to map the ports
-- --env to set the environment variables -- e.g. for mariadb --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root@00


docker ps --> to list all the containers running (along with the generated id)

docker ps -a --> to list all the containers both running and stopped.. 
Stopped containers can be restarted with the <container_reference_name> as well as with the <generated_id> 

docker stop <container_reference_name> or <generated_id> to stop a running container

docker start <container_reference_name> or <generated_id> to start a stopped container

stopped docker container can be rerun with docker start with the same configuration it was running. 



docker rm <> <container_reference_name> or <generated_id> to remove a container. 
Once removed the configuration will be lost. e.g. - mariadb will lost all its created db and tables along with its data.



dokcer logs <container_reference_name> or <generated_id> to see the logs generated by the container. 


docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Execute a command in a running container

e.g. docker exec -it <container_reference_name> or <generated_id> /bin/bash 
-- to get into the putty mode of the running container
